{"name":"IPA translator","tagline":"IPA transcription for sentences on Duolingo","body":"### What's IPA ?\r\n> The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system of phonetic notation \r\n> devised by linguists to accurately and uniquely represent each of the wide \r\n> variety of sounds (phones or phonemes) used in spoken human language. It is \r\n> intended as a notational standard for the phonemic and phonetic \r\n> representation of all spoken languages.\r\n[Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet)\r\n\r\n### IPA for Duolingo\r\nIPA seems difficult to learn, students hate to _waste_ time learning weird \r\nsymbols and later only use 40% of these for a specific language.\r\n\r\nBut Duolingo is not your traditional learning platform. So you could hear in \r\nbasic 1 how to say 'boy' in french `garçon` while relate that word to \r\n`/ɡaʁ.sɔ̃/`. This helps you to have some knowledge when reading words that you \r\nhaven't heard before.\r\n\r\n### Extension\r\nThis extension adds the IPA transcription to translate exercises.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
