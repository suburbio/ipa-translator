### IPA for Duolingo
IPA seems difficult to learn, students hate to _waste_ time learning weird 
symbols and later only use 40% of these for a specific language.

But Duolingo is not your traditional learning platform. So you could hear in 
basic 1 how to say 'boy' in french `garçon` while relate that word to 
`/ɡaʁ.sɔ̃/`. This helps you to have some knowledge when reading words that you 
haven't hear before.

### Extension
This extension adds the IPA transcription to translate exercises.
